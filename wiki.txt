Doki Doki Mod Swapper's user-made files are, by default, at:
WINDOWS: N/A
LINUX: .local/share/doki-doki-mod-swapper
MACOS: N/A
The only needed file is "location.json". Everything else can be moved accordingly with the changed location

Doki Doki Mod Swapper's files are structured like so:
game/: Contains the base DDLC left as-is. When a mod gets launched, the required files are added via symlink. Pre-existing files get suffixes
mods/: Contains subfolders of mods, extracted and untouched
appdata/: Contains subfolders of savedata for every mod
modlist/: Contains the DDLC Mod List Spreadsheet
downloads/: Contains archives of mods. They promptly get deleted when they get installed
